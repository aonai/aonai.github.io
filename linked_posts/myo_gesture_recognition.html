            Surface electromyograms (sEMG) signals are often used with machine learning techniques to recognize hand 
            gestures. This project aims at investigating the performance of Self-Calibrating Asynchronous Domain Adversarial Neural 
            Network (SCADANN) on recognizing gestures from sEMG recorded across multiple days or even multiple subjects. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Suguru Kanoga proved in the paper that reattachment of sEMG armband devices generally leads to 
            lower classification accuracies, especially when the sensors are misplaced. If a model
            is trained using only sEMG signals recorded on the first few days, errors can range from around 9% to 
            30%<a href="#references">[1]</a>.
            In order to decrease the classification errors, Ulysee Côté-Allard proposed SCADANN. This algorithm is developed based on 
            Temporal-Spatial Descriptors (TSD) and Domain-Adversarial Neural Network (DANN). First, all training data are put 
            into TSD to result in a set of weights. Then, DANN uses the first training session as a labeled source and others 
            as the unlabeled target. After DANN calibrates the weights, SCADANN recalibrates them again using a labeled first 
            session of training and several pseudo-labeled training sets
            <a href="#references">[2]</a>.
            Here, one session indicates either one wearing position
            (for inter-day training) or one subject (for across subject training).
            <br>
            <br>
            To get myself familiar with sEMG readings, I use

            This project uses 
            <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Thalmic-Labs-Gesture-Control-Presentations/dp/B00VHWBH02" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">myo armband </a>
            to collect sEMG signals on the left forearm. 
            Three sets of data are collected. Each dataset represents one wearing position: neutral, inward rotation, and outward
            rotation. These positions are explained in Kanoga's paper and the picture below 
            <a href="#references">[1]</a>.
            Assuming that the neutral position is 
            defined when I first put on the myo armband and use the myo sdk to calibrate it, then the inward and outward rotations
            are around 8mm counter-clockwise and clockwise rotated from this first placement before recording. 
            During each trial, five wave-out, 
            or wrist extension (WE), motions are recorded. Each wave-out lasts around 2 seconds, and there is a 1 second rest period in 
            between each motion. During the recording, my left forearm is placed similar to the demonstration shown below and is held
            steady. 
        </p>

            One example segment is extracted from each dataset. The sampling frequency of myo armband is 200 Hz, so each 1.5s
            window of signals has 300 readings. The images below show EMG and IMU readings of one segment of motion. As shown
            in the plots, active sEMG signals are generally noisier when myo is placed on inward and outward rotation positions
            than when it's placed at the neutral attachment.

        <p>
            As explained in the 
            <a href="#intro">introduction</a>, SCADANN is trained based on TSD and DANN models. Details of each model are explained 
            in Ulysee's paper
            <a href="#references">[2]</a>. The signals are processed into windows of size 150ms every 100ms and applied with feature
            extraction functions proposed by Khushaba 
            <a href="#references">[4]</a>. 
            The image below shows the result of reusing Ulysee's code training inter-day data for three 
            subjects in the Long-term 3DC Dataset
            <a href="#references">[3]</a>. 
            During the training, four sessions (or four different positions) are recorded for each participant, 
            SCADANN uses the TSD model from the first session and previous DANN models (ie. the second and third DANN models if the fourth session is 
            being trained). Stepping from TSD to DANN, and from DANN to SCADANN models, gesture recognition accuracies increase from 70% to 
            76% and eventually to 78%. This trend indicates that SCADANN is feasible for increasing the performance of inter-day 
            training within one subject of the 3DC dataset. 
        </p>

        <img src="../img/portfolio/3DC_results.jpg" style="width:100%">

        <hr class="para-break" data-content="  Myo Result  " id="myo-result">
        <p>
            To test that SCADANN also works for Kanoga's myo datasets, I modified the way to process the data into a similar
            shape used in the source code. Instead of defining each day as one session, I include all readings from 
            the same position (neutral position, inward, and outward rotation) in one session. This way, each session contains 10 days (4 
            trails each day) of training data. The signals are processed into windows of size 250ms every 50ms and applied with 
            Khushaba's feature extraction functions
            <a href="#references">[4]</a>. Another modification to the source code is that the variable percentage_same_gesture_stable, 
            or how accurate a segment of stable examples
            should be in order to be pseudo labeled, is changed to 75% to allow sufficient, stable, and accurate training data for SCADANN. 
            The image below shows the result of training inter-day sEMG readings within each subject. The performance is similar
            to the 3DC result. Training across days, locations, and subjects all show increasing trends from TSD to SCADANN, 
            so this algorithm is feasible for training long-term sEMG signals. 
        </p>
        <img src="../img/portfolio/myo_overall_improvement.jpg" style="width:50%" >  

        <hr class="para-break" data-content="  Across Days  " id="across-days">
        <p>
            To train the models across days, I rewrote the way to process the myo datasets. 
            By default, trials recorded when wearing sensor at the same locations are lumped together. 
            One session now only includes trials on one day. This means that SCADANN is trained for a total of 
            10 session, or 10 days. To have the train dataset follows a similar pattern, across day training is applied to 
            one subject and one location at a time. The image below shows the result of applying TSD, DANN, and SCADANN to 
            dataset of five subjects wearing sensor at the neutral position. 
        </p>
        <img src="../img/portfolio/myo_across_days.jpg" style="width:80%" >  

        <p>
            Looking only at the average accuracy of individual participants across all days above, 
            overall and most individual accuracies are increasing (the overall accuracy increases from 66% to 74%), 
            so SCADANN is feasible in improving accuracy when trained across days.
            However, SCADANN does not improve accuracy when training for subject_0 on day 1 and 2; accuracies 
            decrease by 2.2% and 1.2% respectively. Looking closely at the gestures accuracies, 
            some gestures are not recognizable by the model. For instance, when testing
            accuracy of gesture 4 (UD) for subjnect_0 across 10 days. Accuracies for day 1, 2, 3, 4, and 7 decreases 
            when from TSD to SCADANN. Occasionally, SCADANN increases gesture accuracy (e.g. accuracy increases from 
            27% to 77% when trained from DANN to SCADNN). Notice that the clipping percentage for SCADANN is set to be 
            75%, so it is reasonable that certain gestures with low accuracies will result in low performance as well. 
            Another for the decreasing trend may be that the dataset is not 
            sufficient for training a robust model. The total number of trials per wearing location is 40. 
            If distributing these trials among 10 days, each day will only include 4 trials. This means that
            the model is receiving a bad dataset. Regardless, SCADANN still proves to have a better performance
            when all tests are considered
        </p>

        <hr class="para-break" data-content="  Across Locations  " id="across-locs">
        <p>
            When training the long-term myo dataset across locations, SCADANN is using weights from the previous location 
            (in order of neutral position, inward, and outward) on the same subject. Below is a plot of testing accuracies 
            of applying TSD, DANN, and SCADANN in sequence within each location. The overall accuracy increases from 72% 
            to 79%), so SCADANN is feasible in improving accuracy when training across wearing locations. The overall acurracy 
            for inter-location training is generally better than other cases. Though wearing location is to decrease the 
            model performance, it seems to have less effect than other controlling factor such as subjects and days. 
        </p>
        <img src="../img/portfolio/myo_across_loc.jpg" style="width:80%" >  

        <hr class="para-break" data-content="  Across Subjects  " id="across-subs">
        <p>
            It is possible to apply SCADANN algorithm across subjects. To test the performance in this case, I rewrote the 
            way to process the myo datasets. Previously, the sEMG signals are grouped based on positions. To train the models 
            across subjects, one session now contains all readings from the same participant when wearing myo at the 
            same location.  To cover all possible cases,
            training datasets are ordered such that the first group includes signals from a starting subject. 
            Each subject's model is trained based on the previous subject's model. That is, if the starting subject is subject_0,
            then the following models are trained based on weights for subject_0, subject_1, subject_2, and subject_3 in sequence. 
            The image below shows the 
            result of TSD, DANN, and SCADANN models for each subject when they are trained starting from subject_0.
            The plots have a similar increasing trend in performance. The overall accuracy increases from 54% 
            to 61% and eventually to 63%. 
        </p>
        <img src="../img/portfolio/myo_across_subs.jpg" style="width:80%" >  
        <p>
            The base model trained using subject_0 is not good at predicting gestures for other subjects, 
            so the overall accuracy remains low compared to across location training. Unlike misplacement in device 
            reattachment, classifier performance is worse if a model trained for one person is used on another subject.
            Considering all cases, subject_3 is best at predicting gestures from subject_4, SCADANN improves accuracy by 21%. 
            Subject_1 is worst at predicting gestures from subject_1, SCADANN only increases by 5%. In conclusion, 
            SCADANN is feasible in increasing the performance of across-subject training; however, the resulting accuracies 
            on each subject are dependent on how well the base model (the first set of TSD weights that use only one
            participant data) can predict signals from other subjects.
        </p>
        <img src="../img/portfolio/myo_across_sub_mean.jpg" style="width:100%" >  

        <hr class="para-break" data-content="  ConvNet vs. TSD  " id="convnet-vs-tsd">
        <p>
            Given previous results, a conclusion for training SCADANN is that the base model needs to be good at 
            predicting the following models. To prove it, SCADANN trained based on TSD is compared to results of 
            SCADANN when it's trained based on Convolutional Network (ConvNet) across wearing locations. 
            As shown in the plot below, TSD as a base model has a better performance than ConvNet.  
        </p>
        <img src="../img/portfolio/myo_convnet_vs_tsd.jpg" style="width:60%" > 
        <p>
            Looking closer to accuracies for each wearing location, the biggest increase in performance happens
            from TSD to SCADANN at wearing location 2 (from 65% to 76%), 
            whereas the smallest increase happens at wearing location 1 of the same training direction 
            (from 69% to 73%). Similarly, SCADANN trained based on ConvNet 
            increases by 11% (from 53% to 64%) at wearing location 1, but it only increases by 6% 
            (from 57% to 63%) at wearing location 2. So, it is possible for SCADANN to largely increase 
            accuracy of one sesssion while keeping a low overall accuracy. However, considering the resulting
            SCADANN performance, it is best to start from a model with good testing accuracies. 
        </p>
        <img src="../img/portfolio/myo_convnet_vs_tsd_details.jpg" style="width:80%" > 

        <p>
            In conclusion, SCADANN can improve accuracy in classifying gestures recorded by low-end and 
            low-frequency wearable sensors. To optimize the final performance of the model, the first base 
            model should be trained using a good algorithm and a good dataset. That is, the algorithm should 
            be suitable for training predicting gestures from sEMG signals, and the dataset should include enough 
            amount of recording trails.
